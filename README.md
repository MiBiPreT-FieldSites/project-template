## Using this template

1. **Please _do not fork this repository directly on GitHub._** Instead,
   use GitHub's function to copy this template repository and customize it for
   your workshop. On this page (<https://github.com/MIBIREM/project-template>),
   click on the blue _'Use this template'_ button (top right) and select 
   _'Create a new repository'_.

2. Select the owner for your new repository. This should be the `MIBIREM` GitHub organisation.

3. Choose a name for your repository.

4. Make sure the repository is public, leave "Include all branches" unchecked.
   Click on "Create repository from template". You will be redirected to
   your new repository.

5. Adapt the CITATION.cff file with your own details. You can use
   [the online tool](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript) to
   create the content for the file and copy it in or use the update functionality.
